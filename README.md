# Ashfox

**Assets as Code. Built for voxel games.**

### Write the source. Build the world.

**Models. Textures. Sound. All from code.** Ashfox compiles native `.ashfox`
files into game assets you can version, review and rebuild alongside your game.

## Use this fork with your agent

This fork installs globally as `sya-ri-ashfox` alongside the official `ashfox`.
Choose a source directory and share one installation across your projects.
Copy this prompt into your coding agent; optionally specify the source directory
or request an update in the same message.

```text
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sya-ri/ashfox/main/docs/fork-agent.md
in full and follow its setup or update instructions.

Build and install sya-ri-ashfox globally so it can be used across my projects.
Use the source directory I specify. Otherwise, follow the guide's directory
selection rules. Reuse an existing fork checkout and remember its location
for future updates.

Keep the official Ashfox installation and unrelated files intact.
Update an existing installation only if I requested an update.
Preserve local source changes.

After setup, create and verify the assets I requested. If I have not described
an asset yet, ask what I want to make.
```

See the [fork setup and update guide](docs/fork-agent.md) for manual installation,
source locations and rebuilding local changes. The linked website describes
the upstream product; use this guide to install the fork.

## Game assets, with a source of truth

A creature's proportions, its pixels, its rig and its motions can live in source
files. So can the sound it makes. Ashfox turns those definitions into assets for
voxel games and Minecraft.

That is **Assets as Code**: the editable asset lives in your repository.
Your coding agent can work on it, your team can review the change, and your build
can produce the deliverables.

## What this makes possible

| The problem | What Ashfox gives you |
| --- | --- |
| Understanding what changed in an asset | Source diffs paired with rendered views, native pixels and sound playback. |
| Keeping related assets consistent | Shared designs, components, surfaces and motions with explicit contracts. |
| Rebuilding the assets for a game revision | Versioned sources and a pinned compiler, with deterministic builds and verifiable outputs. |
| Taking assets from creation into a game | Portable GLB, PNG and audio, game bundles and Minecraft resource packs from the same source project. |

Resize a creature through shared dimensions. Keep its eyes one pixel wide.
Reuse its rig across motions. Review the result and commit the source alongside
the game that uses it.

## Start with a sword. Build a creature.

Explore complete sources and take the compiled assets into your game.
The creatures share a [reusable source project](examples/shared-creatures/).

## Build on it

Ashfox is an open-source toolkit for developers and coding agents building voxel
games, reusable asset libraries and Minecraft content. The compiler checks
structure, types and bindings; captures and playback let you judge the result.
